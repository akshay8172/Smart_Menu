Restaurant Order Management System


The Restaurant Order Management System is a Python Django-based solution designed to streamline restaurant operations by enabling customers to place orders using QR codes. This project addresses common restaurant challenges by automating the ordering process, improving operational efficiency, and reducing wait times, which collectively enhances customer satisfaction. 
This system eliminates the need for staff to take orders manually by allowing customers to scan a QR code at their table to place orders directly through their smartphones. The orders are sent to the kitchen in real-time, simplifying order management and improving service speed.
